# Elizabeth Profile
#ORIGINAL CONCEPT:
This repository started as a school project for Class WebD168
The goal was to create a professional profile and learn to use Bootstrap and Sass. 
This site has a combination of a few programming languages, such as PHP, JavaScript, CSS, SASS, and HTML.

#UPDATES:
The current version was modified to add more work experience and other projects, such as the WordPress project.
I am adding a dynamic resume in PDF to ease navigation. 

All links are real sources, and the contact form goes directly to my email.
